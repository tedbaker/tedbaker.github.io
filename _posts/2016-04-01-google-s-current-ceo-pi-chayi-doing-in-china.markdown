These days, Google current CEO sangdaer·pichayi visited Beijing, attracted the attention of many people.　　Why Google\'s CEO came to China, what signal is released? This is probably a lot of people want to ask questions. Combined with Google before adding a group of Asia-Pacific server message, but also to the imagination.

Pi Chayi come and go this time for artificial intelligence. [Moschino cases](http://omogemura.com/17-picks-milan-fashion-week-2016/moschino-5/)　　Today Pi Chayi arrived NIE Weiping chess center, \"Qisheng\" under the leadership of NIE Weiping visited the school. Meanwhile, Pi Chayi with Chinese go player Ke Jie nine segments, the charm of Gu Li nine paragraphs to talk about chess, science and technology, and exchange of students.　　Ke Jie section of the current world number one, also symbolically and Pi Chayi sat on each side of the Board game a few steps.　　As we all know, earlier this month, Google\'s artificial intelligence Alphago in the field of chess challenges human, and Korea top chess players play against Li Shishi, ended in a 4:1 win over Li Shishi.　　And Alphago with the game won, and promoted to go nine, ranked second in the world, second only to Ke Jie.[![Alt Moschino iPhone 6 plus cover]([[7, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h061/h07/img201603311853410.jpg\', \"Google\'s current CEO Pi Chayi doing in China?\", \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1470/25548985313_1aa05eeda3_b.jpg\'], [12, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h061/h07/img201603311853411.jpg\', \"Google\'s current CEO Pi Chayi doing in China?\", \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1532/25548993413_24ccb6c3bb_b.jpg\'], [14, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h061/h07/img201603311853412.jpg\', \"Google\'s current CEO Pi Chayi doing in China?\", \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1677/26125711596_b5b85e921b_b.jpg\'], [14, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h061/h07/img201603311853413.jpg\', \"Google\'s current CEO Pi Chayi doing in China?\", \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1679/25549008313_c0c70bf402_b.jpg\'], [14, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h061/h07/img201603311853424.jpg\', \"Google\'s current CEO Pi Chayi doing in China?\", \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1477/26151665325_44e70f8548_b.jpg\'], [14, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h061/h07/img201603311853425.jpg\', \"Google\'s current CEO Pi Chayi doing in China?\", \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1612/26125731336_3c4dcb15ea_b.jpg\']])](http://www.nodcase.com/moschino-french-fries-silicone-case-for-iphone-6-plus-p-4319.html)　　Ke Jie also appeared to challenge Google AlphaGo at Twitter and wrote: \"come on! you are afagou or Alfa Laval cat! I Ke Jie Qi storms seen? made storms more violent point!\"　　In addition, AlphaGo developer, founder DeepMind Kazakhstan more than once expressed the hope that the AlphaGo\'s next opponent is Ke Jie. So, this time Google CEO to visit NIE Weiping chess center, and met with the Ke Jie section, I do not know whether this works for both a war will come.　　Alphago in the field of chess after defeated Li Shishi, rumours, it\'s next challenge will be StarCraft 2. Blizzard Entertainment producer Tim Morten said at WCS China final, AlphaGo make sure that the challenge of the StarCraft 2, but Google is currently communicating with Blizzard, the details are yet to be decided. However amusing is that Google has been silent on the matter, whether it be disregarded.　　According to the AlphaGo challenge Li Shishi of example, Google team on this challenge should be governed by strict security measures and agreements. In the vast majority of plans are coordinated well after the only foreign official.　　After the news broke, many competing players to war with Alphago, have confidence and believe that against AlphaGo, its main source of confidence is not transparent in the information environment, disguise, attacked humans can take a variety of tactics. But Chinese chess man-machine war has given humans a lesson, not simply as a AlphaGo a computer through advanced learning technology, he plays chess (Star Trek) performance and a human expert when there is no difference, and this person will not be tired, not mental fluctuations, not care about winning, so we also are not to be taken lightly.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology , The characterIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
