Oh well of color, good painting about the practical. Paste at the end of the actual effect is closer to pale purple silver paste delicate, Pearl is beautiful, not very Flash, a little ornate, suitable for all kinds of makeup, very versatile. Laitiliang is also very good. Pink eye shadow with shimmer, but color is very good, and the color is. Cute pink eyes and not throwing up, the effect is to my satisfaction. Small, dark brown eye shadow can be tinged smoke, no Pearl, matching any color looks good. And paint quickly and evenly. Three colors whether it is used with other colors or separate, the effect is good. Follow the method to draw on the boxes, you can have a beautiful everyday makeup. Very intimate. Another I like is packed and lovely, smudger hid in the bottom of a drawer, sanitary and convenient. Recommended to you and MM.![Alt Perfect tone eyeshadow](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1551/25388424766_68ce5e71ff_z.jpg)But it\'s pretty good!
