To say any transparent material, you would never think of aluminum body, however fast technological development and nothing is impossible. From the United States Naval Research Laboratory of Dr Jas Sanghera claimed to have developed a transparent aluminum.

Jas Sanghera description says it is a magnesium alloy. As long as the vacuum in the right way on mg-Al powder for high pressure squeeze, squeeze the air, finally can get transparent aluminum.　　So what does the transparent aluminum? It is much better than glass toughening, and able to withstand dust and rain erosion, is a better building materials. In addition, the transparent aluminum used in auto manufacturing industry is on the right.

If the material\'s manufacturing costs can be controlled, then we may be able to see it at the mobile phones, flat.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology\r Design And anecdotesIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
